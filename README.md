# Professor Turo
A Poketwo Discord helper human. Absolutely not a bot.

Professor Turo will sit in your Poketwo Discord channels and lock channels for an hour (with the help of Dyno bot) if a player's shiny hunt spawns (and called out via PokeName). He also talks a **lot** to help Pokemon spawn in your chnanels.

He will also lock channels permanently if a rare Pokemon spawns. 

Turo will send the command ``?shlock`` if PokeName tags a shiny hunt. ``?shlock`` will trigger Dyno bot and deny the "everyone" permission to send messages to the channel for one hour. This requires Poketwo to not have explicit send permissions on the spawn channels. He does a very good job of it too.

## Future ideas
* Turo will post a timestamp of when the channel will be unlocked.
* Cooldown of a shiny hunt ping so that online players don't have to unlock a channel straight away.

## Known issues
* Turo will shiny lock channels for AFK spawns
